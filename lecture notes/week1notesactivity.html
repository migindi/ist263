        <p2> The Hildegarde and J. Myer Schine Student Center is the hub of activity at Syracuse University. Dedicated in 1985, the Schine Student Center was designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes as a three-level building with four wings that pinwheel off a central atrium covered by a lantern-shaped glass roof. The Schine Student Center houses the 1,500-seat Goldstein Auditorium, multiple small and medium-sized event spaces, Schine Dining Center, campus store, meeting rooms, lounges, and offices. </p2>
