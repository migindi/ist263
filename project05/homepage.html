      <h2>Recomendations</h2>
      <p>
        Enjoy your food.
        <br>
        Eat breakfast every day - Eat within 1 hour of waking and include protein such as eggs, peanut butter or Greek yogurt.
        <br>
        Eat at regular time intervals - preferably every 3-4 hours or so. Hunger builds when you go too long without eating which can lead to over eating. If you eat an evening snack, have it between dinner and bedtime.
        <br>
        Eat to be "smart" -foods that contain iron, B vitamins and Vitamin C. Eat lean red meat, spinach, whole grain breads and cereal, eggs, nuts, apples and carrots.
        <br>
        Eat Fruit - it ranks high among the best foods you can eat for your brain. The natural sugars in it offer clean energy, so you don't experience the crash that follows consumption of refined sugar.
        <br>
        Choose powerful vegetables - The more darker the color, the higher the concentration of nutrients. Great vegetable choices include spinach, broccoli, tomatoes and sweet potatoes.
        <br>
        Choose lean proteins - Including chicken, turkey, fish, tofu, beans, cottage cheese, lean cuts of pork and beef
        <br>
        Include healthy fats - Omega oils and plant fats are amazing for your brain, heart and inflammation. They also help fill you up and stabilize blood sugar. Avocado, nuts, nut butters, seeds, fish, olives, and olive oil.      </p>
