    <h1> Michael Gindi-Kolker's Biography</h1> 
<main>
<p> 
 My name is Michael Gindi-Kolker. I major in <strong> Web Development and Design </strong> in the school of information studies at Syracuse University. I am specifically interested in front end web design. I am hardworking, patient, very communicative, tech savvy, a problem solver, and organized. Outside of work and school, I enjoy skiing with friends and family and working out to maintain a healthy lifestyle.  I like watching comedy central tv shows as well as horror movies. My parents are divorced and I have many siblings because of my step parents.
